Some separation is apparent, so you don't get a sense of harmonious living; neighbourhoods seem to be made up primarily of one group or another, but they all brush shoulders at the shops and in the squares without hostility. The buildings are roughly constructed but well-maintained, the streets are cramped but clean. The thoroughfares are filled with conversation, laughter, sorrow and joy. It is truly the shining jewel of the Danuthan Kingdom, although you'd never hear that from the rest of the kingdom.",

Exploring further reveals that the impressive buildings are merely ornate walls, keeping the world and its problems out of sight. There is litter in the corners, dark alleys that seem foreboding compared to the utilitarian feel of South Ablein.
